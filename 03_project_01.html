						<h3>Overview</h3>
					</div>


					<p>Nautical Cats is a 2D platformer player versus player (PVP) capture the fish game. The essential idea behind the game is for players to collect Fish and have more Fish in the chest than their opponents before the time runs out.</p>
					<p>In the team, I was responsible for the implementation of the entire game from prototyping, alpha to beta. Collaborating and communication with other team member who handled game mechanisms, art design and level design, I put all elements into Unity and constructed them into the actual game.</p>

						<h3>Early Stage: Prototyping</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="col-3of6">
						<p>In the early stage, when the team came up with the brief game idea and potential core game mechanism, I have made an early prototype for the team to have a better vision of the scope of the our final product. This prototype contained a controller character created using 2D Rigidbody and random character image. The character is able to general moves such as walking and jumping. I have also added attack which can one-shot dummy character to provide a foundation for the later implementation.</p>

						<h3>Alpha</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="col-3of6">
						<p>The first prototype, Alpha, had all core game mechanisms, including basic character movement, combat system, interaction with fish and chest, and winning condition. In addition, we included two different characters which inherits from same character class to test game balance. For the game graphic, besides the characters and map, We also have score display. With the alpha, we were able to conduct user tests. From the feedback, we realized the issue in game balance (attack damage & jump height) and visual feedback such as unclear animation.</p>

						<h3>Beta</h3>
					</div>
					<p>For our Beta version, we have polished visual elements (sprites & animations), improved game balance based on the user tests, and fixed bugs. In addition, we added two more playable characters and two more maps. For each map, we also included more dynamic map interaction and effect such as temporarily disappearing platform and  falling objects that damage players in order to give more variety and depth in the our game. Finally, we completed the game with UI screen including home menu, character selection and loading.  And very last, I was able to connect four game pads for a better game inputs..</p>
